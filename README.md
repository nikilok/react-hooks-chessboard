# React Chess

React chess is a chess board UI build using React Hooks. It is built on top of chess.js which handles move validations, move states etc.

In order to run this you will need to also setup the server side project located here.

You can open two seperate browsers on the same machine and queue up for a game to enter the chess board. Incognito mode won't help queue up for games from the same browser as I fingerprint the browser to establish user uniqueness.
